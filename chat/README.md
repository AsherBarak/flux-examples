# chat

Ported from https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/master/examples/flux-chat

This shows the full Flux flow from server to client as well as XHR posts for creating new messages so that they are persisted between page loads.

## Usage

Make sure you run `npm install` from the root of flux-examples.

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Dev Mode

Again, make sure you run `npm install` from the root of flux-examples.

This uses `nodemon` and `webpack` to watch for changes and restart and rebuild as needed.

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000
