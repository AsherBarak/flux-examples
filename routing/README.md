#routing

This shows routing on the client and the server. Navigation uses history pushes on the client but browser refresh will render the current page correctly on the server.

Usage
-----

Make sure you run `npm install` from the root of flux-examples.

```
npm run build
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:3000
